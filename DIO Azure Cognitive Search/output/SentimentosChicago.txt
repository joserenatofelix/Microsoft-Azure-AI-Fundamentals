I also love their local music. Fourth Coffee brings in rising artists every weekend. I like to head over there mid-afternoon on weekdays when itâ€™s not too busy and get a slice of pie or their seasonal baked goods.  \nDate: August 13, 2018\nLocation: Chicago, Illinois  \n\nimage1.png\n\nimage2.png\n\n",

I own a small business and the folks who work at Fourth Coffee are always very friendly. It leaves a good impression on my clients. There are also plenty of drink selections, good wi-fi, and seating. Some of my favorite coffees are the lavender honey latte and, in the winter, the apple-chai latte. There are delicious baked goods offered as well. \nDate: October 21, 2018\nLocation: Chicago, Illinois \n\nimage1.png\n\n",
